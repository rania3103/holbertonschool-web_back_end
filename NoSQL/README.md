## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It's a type of database that doesn't rely on the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) structure. Instead, it provides a more flexible way to store and retrieve data, making it suitable for scenarios where the data is dynamic and doesn't fit neatly into tables.
